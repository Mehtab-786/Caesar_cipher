# Caesar_cipher

Welcome to the Caesar Cipher program! This simple console-based program allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher technique.

## What is Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This shift value is known as the key.

## How to Use
1. Run the Python script.
2. Choose whether you want to 'encode' or 'decode' a message.
3. Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
4. Enter the shift value, which represents the key for the Caesar Cipher.
5. Get the result!
